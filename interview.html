									<p>In the first term of university, our fundamentals of computer Programming instructor (Dr. Sauleh Eetemadi) asked us to interview a successful person in the field of computer. I arranged a meeting with Ms.Bahareh Asgary and interviewed her.</p>

									<h4>Please provide a general biography of your life.</h4>
									<p>
										I entered computer engineering at the Science and Industry University in 2007 and chose the hardware field in my third year due to my interest in this area. Fortunately, I became the top student in the master's program. In my second year of the master's degree, I started teaching at Shahid Rajaei and Azad universities in Tehran, and in my third year, I worked part-time at a computer company. After that, I applied to one of the universities in the United States and I am currently a fourth-year doctoral student.
									</p>

									<h4>Did you have any problem working while studying?</h4>
									<p>
										With the time management I had, I didn't have any problem working simultaneously with my studies. Doing all these tasks was time-consuming but I didn't feel any pressure. Interestingly, the experiences I gained through working in the company were very valuable to me, to the point that I believe these experiences could not be gained only through university. Working provided me an opportunity to practically apply what I learned in university and see its application in the real world.
									</p>

									<h4>Did you plan to pursue a doctoral degree from the beginning or did you decide to continue your education based on the existing conditions, and is a degree important to you?</h4>
									<p>
										Yes, I had decided to pursue a doctorate from the beginning due to my interest, and in my opinion, the degree is really important and can have an impact on finding a job. However, this may vary in different fields, and it may be possible to find a good job with a bachelor's degree in one field, but not in another.
									</p>

									<h4>In a crossroads between experience and university, which one do you choose</h4>
									<p>
										This crossroad is difficult, but I choose the third way, which is to study at university and then gain experience through work.
									</p>

									<h4>In your opinion, which university courses are more important than other courses?</h4>
									<p>
										In my opinion, courses like programming, data structures, algorithms, and computer architecture are very important, but it does not necessarily mean that you have to get a good grade in them or necessarily pass them the first time. This is because no one looks at your grades for employment; it is only the amount of information you have and how you can apply that knowledge that matters to them.
									</p>

									<h4>What company are you currently working for?</h4>
									<p>
										During my doctoral studies, I was an intern at Apple, but currently, as I am in the final year of my PhD, I am not working for any company.
									</p>

									<h4>How did you get into Apple company? What were the steps of its acceptance process?</h4>
									<p>
									First, I sent my resume to the company, and then they interviewed me, which included technical and personality questions. After being accepted, I joined the company.
									</p>

									<h4>What were your challenges at work, especially at Apple? Have you ever faced a problem that you couldn't solve?</h4>
									<p>
										To be honest, I found the work environment at Apple to be very good. If a problem arose, everyone would help until the problem was eventually resolved. If someone succeeded, they would also help others to achieve success. But overall, one of the challenges was how to present information to colleagues, explaining how a program works in a way that everyone understands
									</p>

									<h4>Can you please describe a typical workday at Apple?</h4>
									<p>
										We planned the tasks by dividing them among each team leader to finish them within a certain period of time. Sometimes there would be meetings as well. I always tried to separate work matters from my personal life after 8 hours of work in the company when I returned home.
									</p>

									<h4>How secure was your job at Apple?</h4>
									<p>
										In my opinion, job security in large companies is higher than in small ones. During my internship, job security was very high, and if a person is committed to their work, job security is guaranteed, and there is no need to worry about this issue.
									</p>

									<h4>In your opinion, how much can job satisfaction and happiness be affected by work?</h4>
									<p>
										The answer to this question depends on what a person expects from their life or what goals they have set for themselves. For me, job satisfaction and work have a significant impact on my life, but I believe that happiness is not solely dependent on these factors. In fact, work-related issues are necessary to create this feeling, but they are not sufficient. Therefore, everyone should pursue a job that they enjoy.
									</p>

									<h4>Do you think being in Iran creates limitations? If you were in Iran, would you achieve the same level of success with the same amount of effort that you have now?</h4>
									<p>
										First, I should say that in my opinion, being in Iran creates certain limitations. For example, during the doctoral period, you have to think about earning income, which can make it difficult to fully focus on university coursework. Also, since the student may not have financial support from a sponsoring source, it may be harder for them to attend a conference outside the country. However, this may vary among different individuals. Many of my friends in Iran are successful and may not feel limited, and I am not sure about the second question, but I think with the same amount of effort, I would still have achieved the same level of success that I have now.
									</p>

									<h4>Is there a topic that I haven't asked you about, but you want to talk about it?</h4>
									<p>
										Yes. There is never just one way to succeed. There are as many ways to succeed as there are humans. The important thing is to know what you expect from life on this path.
